# DPM_Group6_Final
Semester long project done in teams of 6 people. We each had a role. I was the software engineer. We used the leJOS environment to build a robot which could avoid obstacles, identify colours, pick rings up, navigate through tunnels, follow walls, etc. This is the final submission of the code.
