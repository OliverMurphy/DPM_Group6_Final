# DPM_Group6_Final
Semester long project done in teams of 6 people. We each had a role. I was the software engineer. We used the leJOS environment to build a robot to localize itself on a grid, avoid obstacles, navigate through a tunnel, reach a tree, and pick up and bring back as many rings possible to the initial location.
