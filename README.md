# DPM_Group6_Final
Semester long project done in teams of 6 people. We each had a role. I was the software engineer. We used the leJOS environment to build a robot which could avoid obstacles, identify colours, pick rings up, navigate through tunnels, follow walls,localize itself on a grid, etc. The goal of the project was to localize the robot, reach a tree, pick up and bring back as many rings possible to the initial location.
